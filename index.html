      <h1>Slow Down</h1>
      <p>
        College life can feel fast-paced, but it's important to take time to slow down. Visit the library, enjoy quiet study sessions, and give yourself moments to recharge.
      </p>
      <h1>My Experience:</h1>
      <p>It was Monday in the library at 1:30 p.m. I chose to be there because I needed to read a book for my English class. I had to put all my electronics away and focus on reading. It felt silent at first, then it felt like I was actually in the book, seeing what was happening in real time. Time seemed to move super slow, and it felt as if I was really inside the story. I didn’t hear anything but my own thoughts, and my eyes were glued to the pages, seeing only the letters. I felt like I was traveling back in time. This helped me calm down, allowing my thoughts to slow and become clearer. I would’ve missed the relief this exercise gave me. It truly helped me relax, be in the present moment, and not worry about tomorrow.</p>
